    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pumpkin pie is one of the signature desserts of the fall season. Here we make not a pie, but a tray of miniaturized, individualized pies! 
        Your family and friends will each get their own to enjoy in a single-serve size&mdash;although they'll likely go back for a second or third!
        In addition to being adorable, this also gives more pie crust per bite, complimenting the gooey pumpkin innards.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>Pumpkin pie filling for one 9-inch pie</li>
        <li>2 9-inch pie crust doughs</li>
        <li>Bowl or round cookie cutter 4 inches in diameter</li>
        <li>Muffin tin</li>
        <li>Whipped cream</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425 degrees (F).</li>
        <li>Prep your dough. Using a bowl or cookie cutter, cut out 12 circles from your pie dough.</li>
        <li>Place each circle into a pre-greased muffin tin. Press them in, letting the sides come up for a fun look. Score the bottom of your dough 
            to keep it from bubbling up as it cooks.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare your filling according to the package. Pour the filling into each muffin cup, to the very top.</li>
        <li>Bake at 425 for 15 minutes. Then turn the heat down to 350 and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove each pie from the muffin tin and let cool on a wire rack for a couple of hours to let the filling set.</li>
        <li>Add a dollop of whipped cream to each pie and dig in!</li>
    </ol></p>
