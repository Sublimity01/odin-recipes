    <h2>Descritpion</h2>
    <p>Baked ziti is a low-effort lasagna. You get all of the same delicious pasta and cheese combination you love without needing to 
    take time layering noodles, sauce, and cheese. It's also easier on the fingers not grabbing boiled pasta! This recipe is perfect
    for those who want to go beyond spaghetti but still want an easy recipe. If you can boil pasta and bake something in an oven, then you
    can master this dish.</p>
