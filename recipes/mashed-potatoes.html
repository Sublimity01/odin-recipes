    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mashed potatoes are a classic comfort food, and versatile enough to be enjoyed at a casual dinner or fancy holiday party.
        This recipe adds a level of sophistication that will wow your guests by adding just one ingredient: truffles. Simple enough
        for a farm table, but fancy enough for a French restaurant.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
    <p><ul>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups half and half</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 oz. white truffle butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch chunks. Place them in a large, deep saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil.
            Lower the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, until very tender. Drain and return to the saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the half and half and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until the butter melts. Remove from the heat and 
            add the truffle butter, allowing it to melt. If the butter doesn't melt completely, heat the mixture slightly, but don't allow the 
            truffles to cook! With a hand mixer, beat the potatoes in the pot until they are broken up. Slowly beat in most of the hot truffle 
            cream, the parmesan, and some salt and pepper. Beat until the potatoes are thick and smooth. Save the leftover cream as a topping 
            or for lefovers.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
